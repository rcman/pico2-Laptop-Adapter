To program your Linux machine to use IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange) protocol instead of TCP/IP, you'll need to install and configure the necessary components. IPX is an older protocol primarily used in Novell NetWare networks, but Linux still supports it through kernel modules.
Here's how to set it up:

First, install the IPX utilities package:

sudo apt-get install ipx-utils
(For RPM-based distributions like Fedora/RHEL, use sudo dnf install ipx-utils)

Load the IPX kernel module:

sudo modprobe ipx

Enable IPX support in your kernel configuration:

sudo echo "ipx" >> /etc/modules

Configure your network interface for IPX:

sudo ipx_interface add -p eth0 802.2 0x1234
(Replace "eth0" with your actual network interface and "0x1234" with your desired IPX network number)

Configure IPX routing if needed:

sudo ipx_route add 0x5678 00:11:22:33:44:55 eth0
(Replace "0x5678" with the destination network number and the MAC address with your gateway's address)

Disable TCP/IP on the interface (optional):

sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 -inet up

Set up IPX-based services using tools like ncpfs for NetWare connectivity:

sudo apt-get install ncpfs
Note that completely abandoning TCP/IP might be challenging for modern Linux systems as many services depend on it. You might want to consider running both protocols in parallel for compatibility reasons. Additionally, IPX support is becoming less common in newer kernel versions, so this may not work on the very latest distributions.
Is there a specific reason you're looking to use IPX instead of TCP/IP?
