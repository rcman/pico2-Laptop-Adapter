                                  Laptop Keyboard to USB Converter: Step-by-Step Guide
This guide will help you repurpose a laptop keyboard by converting it to a USB keyboard using a Raspberry Pi Pico and the Teensy 4.0 Laptop Keyboard Controller board shown in your image.
Materials Needed

Laptop keyboard with ribbon cable
Raspberry Pi Pico
Teensy 4.0 Laptop Keyboard Controller PCB
Jumper wires
Micro USB cable
Computer for programming the Pico

Step 1: Hardware Setup

Prepare the laptop keyboard

Carefully remove the keyboard from the laptop if you haven't already
Identify the ribbon cable connector - measure its width and pin spacing to match with the J6, J7, or J8 connectors on the board (1mm, 0.8mm, or 0.5mm)


Connect the keyboard to the controller board

Insert the ribbon cable into the appropriate connector on the PCB
Mount the Pico onto the Teensy footprint (ensure pin alignment)
Alternatively, you can wire the Pico directly to the necessary pins using jumper wires


Power connections

Ensure the 5V, GND, D+, and D- pins from the USB signals section on the board connect to the corresponding pins on the Pico



Step 2: Software Setup

Install CircuitPython on the Pico

Download the latest CircuitPython UF2 file for Raspberry Pi Pico from https://circuitpython.org/
Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico while connecting it to your computer
Drag and drop the UF2 file to the RPI-RP2 drive that appears
The Pico will restart and a CIRCUITPY drive will appear


Install required libraries

Download the Adafruit CircuitPython Bundle from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases
From the bundle, copy these folders to the CIRCUITPY/lib directory:

adafruit_hid
kmk (available from https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/)





Step 3: Matrix Mapping

Install the Keyboard Matrix Mapper

Copy the keyboard-matrix-mapper.py code to the CIRCUITPY drive as code.py
Connect the Pico to your computer via USB
Open a serial console (use Mu Editor, screen, PuTTY, or the Arduino Serial Monitor)


Map your keyboard

Follow the prompts in the serial console
Press each key on the keyboard when prompted
The tool will determine which pins correspond to which rows and columns
At the end, it will generate a matrix_config.py file


Save the mapping results

The tool will save a configuration file to the Pico
Note the recommended ROW_PINS and COL_PINS arrays for your specific keyboard



Step 4: Create Custom Layout

Install the Layout Editor

Replace the code.py file on the CIRCUITPY drive with the custom-layout-editor.py code
Restart the Pico or press its reset button


Create your layout

Open the serial console to access the layout editor
Type create to make a new layout
For each key:

Type map to start mapping a key
Press the physical key you want to map
Choose the keycode from the displayed list


Test your layout with the test command
Save your configuration with the save command


Handle special keys and layouts

Create multiple layouts for different regions (US, UK, ISO, etc.)
Map function keys and special keys according to your preferences
Use the export command to generate KMK-compatible files



Step 5: Final Implementation

Install the Main Keyboard Controller

Copy the pico-keyboard-implementation.py code to the CIRCUITPY drive as code.py
Modify the ROW_PINS and COL_PINS arrays to match your keyboard's matrix
Adjust the LAYOUTS definitions based on your layout preferences


Configure the Layout Selection

Choose your preferred method for layout switching:

Button: Connect a button to a GPIO pin (default GP28)
Key Combo: Use a key combination (default Right GUI key)
Config File: Edit the config.txt file on the CIRCUITPY drive




Final Testing

Connect the Pico to your computer
Test all keys and layout switching functionality
Make any necessary adjustments to the code



Troubleshooting

Keyboard not responding

Verify all connections between the Pico and the controller board
Check that the ribbon cable is properly inserted
Ensure the matrix mapping is correct for your specific keyboard


Keys producing wrong characters

Edit your layout using the custom layout editor
Remap the problematic keys


Cannot switch layouts

Check the layout selection method configuration
If using a button, ensure it's properly connected
If using a key combo, verify the key is mapped correctly


Some keys not working

Run the matrix mapper again to verify all connections
Check for physical damage to the keyboard ribbon or traces



Customizing Further

Modify the KMK firmware to add macros and key combinations
Create specialized layouts for gaming or specific applications
Add LEDs to indicate the current layout or keyboard status
Implement media keys and special function keys

By following these steps, you can successfully convert your laptop keyboard into a USB keyboard using the Raspberry Pi Pico and the Teensy 4.0 Laptop Keyboard Controller board. The provided tools make it easy to map any keyboard layout and customize it to suit your needs.
