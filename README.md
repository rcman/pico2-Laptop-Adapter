# Pico2 USB/keyboard/trackPad adapter plus more


<BR>
The whole point of this adapter is to use any older laptop, utilize the keyboard, trackpad, USB ports all on one board so you could can use an SBC and just put it inside the laptop and connect your board.

The original one was done with the Teensy board but I'm using a Pico2 which is actually cheaper.
<BR>
<BR> I've included the code to program the Pico 2 and this is a work in progress.

originally designed for the Teensy but now takes the Pico2

The Code includes python code for the keyboard editor, keyboard layout
