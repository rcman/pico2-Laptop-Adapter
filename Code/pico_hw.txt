# Raspberry Pi Pico HDMI Adapter - Hardware Guide

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi Pico doesn't have native HDMI output capabilities, but we can create a DPI (Display Parallel Interface) signal that can be converted to HDMI using additional hardware. This guide explains the hardware requirements and connection details.

## Hardware Requirements

### Core Components:
1. Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W
2. DPI to HDMI converter board (options below)
3. Breadboard and jumper wires
4. HDMI cable and display

### DPI to HDMI Converter Options:

#### Option 1: Use a TFP410 Breakout Board
The Texas Instruments TFP410 is a common DPI to HDMI converter chip. You can find breakout boards like:
- [Adafruit DPI TFP410 Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2219) or similar

#### Option 2: Build a Custom Circuit
You can build your own converter using:
- TI TFP410 or ADV7513 chip
- Required passive components (resistors, capacitors)
- HDMI connector
- PCB or prototyping board

#### Option 3: Repurpose a Raspberry Pi HAT
Some users have successfully repurposed:
- [Adafruit DPI TFT Kippah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2453)
- Raspberry Pi DSI to HDMI adapters (with modifications)

## Implementation Notes

### Limitations

1. **Color Depth**: This implementation uses 8 bits total (3R, 3G, 2B) for color, providing 256 colors.
2. **Resolution**: The code is configured for 640x480 @ 60Hz (VGA resolution).
3. **Performance**: The Pico's PIO blocks are fast but have limited memory, restricting complexity.

### Power Considerations

Most DPI to HDMI converters require a 3.3V power source. The Pico can provide 3.3V but with limited current. For reliable operation:

1. Power your Pico with a good quality 5V power supply
2. Consider a separate power source for the converter board if needed

### Signal Integrity

For reliable HDMI signals:
1. Keep wires as short as possible
2. Use a ground plane or multiple ground connections
3. Consider adding small series resistors (33-75 ohm) to signal lines for impedance matching

## Customization Options

### Increasing Resolution
The current code implements 640x480 @ 60Hz. To increase resolution:
1. Adjust the timing parameters (WIDTH, HEIGHT, porch and sync values)
2. You'll need more GPIO pins for higher color depth
3. Higher resolutions may require faster pixel clock rates

### Adding Audio
HDMI supports audio, but this would require:
1. Additional hardware (I2S to HDMI audio encoder)
2. More complex converter board
3. Extra code to generate audio data

## Troubleshooting

If your display shows no signal:
1. Verify all connections and power
2. Check if your display supports the 640x480@60Hz mode
3. Try adjusting the pixel clock timing
4. Ensure the converter board is properly configured

If the image is distorted:
1. Check for proper sync signal timing
2. Verify the color bit mapping
3. Look for noise/interference in your wiring
